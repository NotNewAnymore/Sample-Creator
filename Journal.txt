Early issues:
Colors not appearing as expected- light cyan darker than cyan, for example. "solved" by arranging the colors differently.


Middle (after deciding it's a mid-term project) issues:
Generating multiple samples leads to them being saved as one file, with each sample in sequence.
Had some issues combining sounds together, but the first time it actually ran, the math all worked perfectly! However, it was unable to display the visualization, as it was putting chars into a method written for ints.
