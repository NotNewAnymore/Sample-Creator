Early issues:
Colors not appearing as expected- light cyan darker than cyan, for example. "solved" by arranging the colors differently.


Middle (after deciding it's a mid-term project) issues:
Generating multiple samples leads to them being saved as one file, with each sample in sequence.
Had some issues combining sounds together, but the first time it actually ran, the math all worked perfectly! However, it was unable to display the visualization, as it was putting chars into a method written for ints.
Implemented a basic UI today. For some reason, closing the window does not close it. Otherwise, it is fine.
Added noise setting to UI, but it does not work.
Froze windowing server by updating a window in a different thread with an infinite loop! Learned how to kill ruby from the command line, looked it up using Lynx, found what the process id was using pgrep, killed it using kill. After that, window decorations stopped showing up, and the video desktop background was flickering a bit.
Changed UI to avoid previous issues. Now opens one window at the start, and keeps it open. It's less intuitive, but I don't have time to make it better. Next up: Pulse Width settings!
